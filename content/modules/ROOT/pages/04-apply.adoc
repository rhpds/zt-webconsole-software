Notice that there are a mix of updates available for the system. Some of
these are identified as *Security Updates* by the shield icon in the
*Severity* field.

Security updates can be applied separately from other updates.

Use the *Install Security Updates* button to apply just this set of
updates.

After the security updates are applied, you are prompted to restart the
system so that the updates take effect. We are not yet finished applying
updates, so, for now, please *Ignore* the restart request.
